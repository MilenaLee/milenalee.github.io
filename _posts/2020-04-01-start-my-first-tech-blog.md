I made this blog using [github pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages) and [jekyll theme thanks to Hux](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io).

I used to write a diary on my personal blog. As I started studying software engineering, I also write on my personal blog as a study journal.
As the number of software engineering postings increased, I wanted to gather these contents to create a tech blog and use it in my portfolio.

So I search several tech blog, and finally I've got my own tech blog!
I want to share everything I learn. And I hope it helps people who were newbies like me before (or maybe now).

I worked as Software Engineer who mainly use python at Samsung Electronics for 3 years and now work as Site Reliablity Engineer at Naver Corp. in Seoul.
