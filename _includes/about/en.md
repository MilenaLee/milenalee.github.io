> Revolution begins with one step.

Hi, I am Mihyun Lee, a backend software engineer. I usually make servers and systems using Java and Python, but I also make a frontend using things like Vue and React. 

I live in Seoul, Korea, but I can work abroad and remotely.

I like to collect and study whatever it is. Even without purpose.
It is happiness to live by expanding the horizon of my life with what I learned. :)
